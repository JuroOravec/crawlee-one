   *   For example, to get a notification about an imminent migration to another server.
   *   See {@apilink Actor.events} for details.
   * - It checks that either `APIFY_TOKEN` or `APIFY_LOCAL_STORAGE_DIR` environment variable
   *   is defined. If not, the functions sets `APIFY_LOCAL_STORAGE_DIR` to `./apify_storage`
   *   inside the current working directory. This is to simplify running code examples.
   * - It invokes the user function passed as the `userFunc` parameter.
   * - If the user function returned a promise, waits for it to resolve.
   * - If the user function throws an exception or some other error is encountered,
   *   prints error details to console so that they are stored to the log.
